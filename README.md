# Dictionary

# INTRODUCTION
The C++ dictionary project incorporates hash tables as its core data structure, optimizing the organization and retrieval of words and meanings with constant-time average complexity. A hashing function maps words to specific indices in the hash table, ensuring efficient access. To enhance scalability, the project utilizes file handling for persistent storage, allowing seamless addition, deletion, and modification of entries while dynamically allocating memory based on the evolving dictionary size. This dual approach of hash tables and file handling underscores the project's commitment to efficiency, scalability, and high-performance dictionary management.
